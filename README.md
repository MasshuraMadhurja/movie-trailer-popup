# movie-trailer-popup
In this project, I created a movie trailer popup by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The popup contains a video trailer of a movie and a close icon to exit the popup. Click "Play trailer" in the live demo to open the video pop-up. I used CSS to style the layout and added transitions to make it look visually appealing. Finally, I used JavaScript to handle the popup functionality, including displaying and hiding the popup and controlling the video playback.
